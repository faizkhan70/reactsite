              Advantages of online education or certification?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Online learning isn't new, and it's no longer in debate. The world
              knew its intact powers when the globe was in quarantine. With
              Teams, Gmeets, Zoom, and other online platforms, it's easier to
              get access to expert faculties scattered around the world. Anyone
              who wants to learn and master a skill, from college students to
              working professionals to a person who wants to do a career shift,
              can now access a wide range of subjects through the plethora of
              digital learning. The National Centre for Education Statistics
              states that more than 7 million people have been engaged in online
              learning offered through a degree-granting college or university
              in 2023. No need to explain that it is popular. There's a course
              for everyone: beginners, experts, and PhD scholars, and now
              students who are keen to learn are enrolling in online courses
              more than ever. And why wouldn't they? I mean, you don't have to
              re attend your college classes to master or update yourself with a
              certain skill, make a career shift in your life, learn finance,
              learn marketing, learn designing, and for god's sake, even art.
              Besides this, if you are wondering why it's so popular, how it
              matches up to the traditional learning of physical
              brick-and-mortar classrooms, and more importantly, how it's so
              effective, then read on

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">
              Here are the six pointers that will tell you why you should opt
              for online education:

              Six Major Advantages of Online Education:
            </h2>
            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">1. Flexibility</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              You can learn on your time. With virtual classrooms, you have the
              advantage of opting for a schedule outside of your busy hours. For
              instance, if you are a working professional, you can learn during
              lunch breaks or after your work hours. And if you are a college
              student wanting to learn more skills beside your major, you too
              can do that at a comfortable schedule decided by you. Unlike in
              physical classrooms, where it's impossible to avoid noise and
              distractions, studying virtually ensures that your focus is
              intact.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">
              2. Learning at Your Speed
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              In a class of 40, there are students who grasp things quickly, but
              there are some who take a couple more takes of that lesson. In
              physical classrooms, it wouldn't be possible for the teacher to
              cater to every student's pace. In virtual classrooms, a student
              can learn at their own speed, rewatch and revisit the lecture
              videos to understand a topic more thoroughly. Moreover, it also
              helps them in their note-taking process along with their
              assignment completion.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">3. Reduced Costs</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              It's no surprise that education is expensive—college fees, room
              fees, boarding fees, tuition fees, and there are hundreds of other
              aspects to learning which cost heavily. With online learning, you
              can bypass all this. You can just pay the enrollment fee and get
              started with your learning. You won't have to commute to your
              university's location, which will save money for you. Apart from
              this, you won't have to spend thousands of rupees on textbooks, as
              all the resources and materials are provided through ebooks, PDFs,
              and virtual resources. Not just this, as it's flexible, you can
              even earn a paycheck while learning or getting your degree via
              digital learning.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">4. More Free Time</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Getting up early in the morning, getting ready, and then commuting
              to your college to attend classes, with almost 20 to 10 minutes
              breaks in between, and then reaching back home in the evening
              takes ample time that you have no control over. With virtual
              learning, you have more time to think about your life. You don't
              have to travel long to attend your classes; you can spend that
              time with your family or on your hobbies, doing what you love or
              really want to do. Plus, an effective schedule and taking the
              lectures as per your availability also helps you to retain that
              information in an effective manner
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">
              5. Breaking Geographic Barriers
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              You don't have to board a plane to attend a lecture hosted by a
              foreign university. That is the benefit of online learning—you
              don't have to commute or relocate or worry about getting your
              enrollment in the term year. Virtual learning breaks down all
              these problems and offers a variety of courses designed by expert
              educational institutes, all accessible via your digital device.
              All you have to do is just log in to start learning. The lack of
              geographical constraints also applies to your faculties and
              friends. With virtual learning, you can engage with people
              worldwide and learn about their perspectives and culture, and more
              importantly, how to collaborate with people of different
              backgrounds and localities.

              6. Similar Career Advancement Opportunities
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              There are many misconceptions about online learning that say you
              won't be able to achieve the same outcome or respect from
              employers and companies that you would while attending an
              on-campus program. Truth be told, that's not always the case. With
              online learning, you have more free time that can be used in a
              better sense, like for doing projects, internships, assignments,
              and even jobs. This outline of work will be reflected on your CV.
              It all depends on what and how you articulate the knowledge you
              have learned, not the medium. Moreover, online learning requires
              motivation, discipline, and sheer dedication to learning the
              craft. That itself explains the capability and mindset of the
              student. Besides all that, with online courses, you can get
              personalized education. Your time management skills get enhanced,
              you know how you're doing at each lesson, you have a better track
              of your learning, and you have repeated access to your lectures.
              Still, only you can decide whether online learning is for you or
              not based upon your learning style, speed, method, and your
              professional and personal goals. You should see which of the
              pointers works for you and then choose which form of education
              would yield better results for you—traditional or online learning.
